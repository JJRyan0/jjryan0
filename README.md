### Hi there!

## About Me

I’m a **data-driven problem solver** who thrives at the intersection of data engineering, analytics, and business insight. I specialize in transforming raw data into **actionable intelligence** — empowering organizations to make smarter, faster decisions.

### What I Bring:

- 🔍 **Data Integration & ML Expertise**: Designing and implementing MLOps & ETL pipelines, Data models, Feature engineering, and robust reporting layers.
- 🤝 **Business Alignment**: I bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders to deliver real, measurable outcomes.
- 📈 **Analytics with Impact**: Passionate about turning complex datasets into clear, accessible, and strategic insights.
